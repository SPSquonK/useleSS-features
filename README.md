# Useless systems

A disorganized compilation of things.

Check out the different branchs of the repository :
- [Sphere Grid](https://github.com/SPSquonK/useless-systems/tree/sphere-grid)

All based on [useleSS](https://github.com/SPSquonK/useleSS) so there are
the same unfixed bugs / exploits.

Reviews / PR are welcomed.

## Licence

You should probably not use the systems exposed here.

If you want to do so, it's the usual Boost Licence ;
*aka* if your source code
is distributed and I see my code, I should be able to find my name somewhere
; *aka* I'm paid in visibility.
